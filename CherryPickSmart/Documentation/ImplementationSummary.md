# Service Configuration Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. **Program.cs** - Enhanced with production-ready features
- ✅ Added configuration loading from multiple sources (appsettings.json, environment variables, user config)
- ✅ Implemented named HttpClient with retry and circuit breaker policies
- ✅ Added structured logging with proper configuration
- ✅ Enhanced error handling with different handling for OperationCanceledException
- ✅ Added development mode stack trace output
- ✅ Implemented Polly resilience policies for HTTP calls

### 2. **ApplicationSettings.cs** - New configuration model
- ✅ Created strongly-typed configuration classes
- ✅ Separated Jira and Git settings
- ✅ Added configurable timeouts and defaults

### 3. **appsettings.json** - Configuration file
- ✅ Added logging configuration
- ✅ Added CherryPickSmart section with Jira and Git settings
- ✅ Supports environment-specific overrides

### 4. **ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs** - Improved service lifetimes
- ✅ Changed HttpClient-based services (JiraClient, GitCommandExecutor) to Scoped
- ✅ Changed ReportGenerator to Scoped for better state management
- ✅ Added InteractivePromptService registration

### 5. **JiraClient.cs** - Updated to use Options pattern
- ✅ Refactored to use IOptions<ApplicationSettings>
- ✅ Uses named HttpClient injected via DI
- ✅ Proper field initialization in constructor
- ✅ Base address configuration from settings
- ✅ Fixed JSON deserialization with JsonPropertyName attributes
- ✅ Added case-insensitive JSON deserialization options

### 6. **CherryPickSmart.csproj** - Added required packages
- ✅ Added Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Polly for resilience policies

## Key Benefits Achieved

1. **Resilience**: HTTP calls now have retry and circuit breaker policies
2. **Configuration**: Centralized configuration with multiple sources
3. **Logging**: Structured logging with proper levels and configuration
4. **Testability**: Better DI setup makes unit testing easier
5. **Production Ready**: Better error handling and development/production modes
6. **Performance**: Appropriate service lifetimes reduce memory usage

## Usage

The application now supports configuration through:
1. **appsettings.json** - Default configuration
2. **appsettings.{Environment}.json** - Environment-specific overrides
3. **User config** - ~/.cherry-pick-smart/config.json
4. **Environment variables** - CHERRYPICK_* prefix
5. **Command line** - Override any setting

Example environment variable:
```bash
CHERRYPICK_CherryPickSmart__Jira__Url=https://jira.company.com
```

## Next Steps

Consider implementing:
1. Health checks for monitoring
2. Metrics/telemetry with Application Insights
3. More granular logging categories
4. Configuration validation on startup
5. Secrets management for sensitive data
